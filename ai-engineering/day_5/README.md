In today's assignment, we'll be creating an Agentic LangChain RAG Application.

- 🤝 Breakout Room #1:
  1. Install required libraries
  2. Set Environment Variables
  3. Creating our Tool Belt
  4. Creating Our State
  5. Creating and Compiling A Graph!
  
- 🤝 Breakout Room #2:
  - Part 1: LangSmith Evaluator:
    1. Creating an Evaluation Dataset
    2. Adding Evaluators
  - Part 2:
    3. Adding Helpfulness Check and "Loop" Limits
    4. LangGraph for the "Patterns" of GenAI

### Advanced Build

You are tasked to create an agent with 3 tools that can research a specific domain of your choice.

You must deploy the resultant agent with a React (or Custom) frontend.
