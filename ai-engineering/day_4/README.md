# Submitting Your Homework

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:
1. Create a branch of your `AIE7` repo to track your changes. Example command: `git checkout -b s04-assignment`
2. Responding to the activities and questions in both the `Assignment_Introduction_to_LCEL_and_LangGraph_LangChain_Powered_RAG.ipynb`and `LangSmith_and_Evaluation` notebooks:
    + Option 1: Provide your responses in a separate markdown document:
      + Create a markdown document in the `04_Production_RAG` folder of your assignment branch (for example “ACTIVITIES_QUESTIONS.md”):
      + Copy the activities and questions into the document
      + Provide your responses to these activities and questions
    + Option 2: Respond to the activities and questions inline in the notebooks:
      + Edit the markdown cells of the activities and questions then enter your responses
      + NOTE: Remember to create a header (example: `##### ✅ Answer:`) to help the grader find your responses
3. Add (if you created a separate document), commit, and push your responses to your `origin` repository.

> _NOTE on the `Assignment_Introduction_to_LCEL_and_LangGraph_LangChain_Powered_RAG` notebook: You will also need to enter your response to Question #1 in the code cell directly below it which contains this line of code:_
    ```
    embedding_dim =  # YOUR ANSWER HERE
    ```
