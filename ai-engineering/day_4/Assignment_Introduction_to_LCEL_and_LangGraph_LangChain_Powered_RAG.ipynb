        "\n",
        "# Understanding LangChain Runnables and LCEL\n",
        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",
        "\n",
        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",
        "for result in chain.batch_as_completed([input1, input2, input3]):\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Types of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Language Models**: Like our `ChatOpenAI` instance\n",
        "- **Prompt Templates**: Format inputs consistently\n",
        "- **Retrievers**: Get relevant context from a vector store\n",

        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!\n",

        "\n",
        "> coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications\n",
        "\n",
        "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in our example here, we're focusing on a simpler `State` object:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class State(TypedDict):\n",
        "    question: str\n",
        "    context: list[Document]\n",
        "    response: str\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [Document(page_content=\"...some data...\")],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"The Eiffel Tower is about 324 meters tall...\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The important part is that we have a consistent object (`State`) that's passed around, holding the crucial information as we go from one node to the next. This ensures our application has a single source of truth about what has happened so far and what is happening now.\n",

In such cases, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is different\\ndepending on whether a student attends the intersession. If a student who attends the intersession requests a loan for the\\ncombined term, the loan period includes the standard term plus the intersession. However, if the student attends only the\\nstandard term and is not enrolled in the intersession that is attached to that term, the loan period includes only the\\nstandard term.\\nMaximum Loan Periods\\nThe maximum period for which you may originate a Direct Loan is generally an academic year. However, if your school\\napplies the annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans to a period of time greater than\\nan academic year, you may originate a Direct Loan for that longer period of time. For example, a school might offer an\\n1100 clock-hour program and define the academic year as 900 clock hours but could choose to allow students to receive\\njust one annual loan limit for the entire 1100-hour program. In that case, the loan period would correspond to the length\\nof the program, a period of time that is longer than the academic year.\\nDirect Loan Disbursement Requirements\\nFor general guidance on the timing of disbursements made under the Title IV programs, see Volume 3, Chapter 1. For\\nguidance on reporting Title IV program disbursements through the COD System and the rules for making early\\ndisbursements, late disbursements, and retroactive payments, see Volume 4, Chapter 2.

For example, if a student is expected to be\\nenrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and\\nspring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be\\nenrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering\\nthe fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\\nspring quarters only.\\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\\nmonths.\\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\\nterms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period.\\nFor instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall\\nterm or the spring term.\\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when\\nperiods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\\nMinimum Loan Periods\\nThe minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar.\\nAs explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a\\nDirect Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on\\nwhether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard'),\n",
