## <h1 align="center" id="heading"> 👋 Welcome to the AI Engineer Challenge</h1>

## 🤖 Your First Vibe Coding LLM Application

> If you need an introduction to `git`, or information on how to set up API keys for the tools we'll be using in this repository - check out our [Interactive Dev Environment for LLM Development](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Interactive-Dev-Environment-for-AI-Engineers) which has everything you'd need to get started in this repository!

In this repository, we'll walk you through the steps to create a LLM (Large Language Model) powered application with a vibe-coded frontend!

Are you ready? Let's get started!

<details>
  <summary>🖥️ Accessing "gpt-4.1-mini" (ChatGPT) like a developer</summary>

1. Head to [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sT7rzY_Lb1_wS0ELI1JJfff0NUEcSD72?usp=sharing) and follow along with the instructions!

2. Complete the notebook and try out your own system/assistant messages!

That's it! Head to the next step and start building your application!

  <summary>🏗️ Forking & Cloning This Repository</summary>

1. Fork [this](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge) repo!

     ![image](https://i.imgur.com/bhjySNh.png)

1. Clone your newly created repo.

     ``` bash
     git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge.git
     ```

2. Open the freshly cloned repository inside Cursor!

     ```bash
     cd The-AI-Engineering-Challenge
     cursor .
     ```

3. Check out the existing backend code found in `/api/app.py`

  <summary>🔥Setting Up for Vibe Coding Success </summary>

While it is a bit counter-intuitive to set things up before jumping into vibe-coding - it's important to remember that there exists a gradient betweeen AI-Assisted Development and Vibe-Coding. We're only reaching *slightly* into AI-Assisted Development for this challenge, but it's worth it!

1. Check out the rules in `.cursor/rules/` and add theme-ing information like colour schemes in `frontend-rule.mdc`! You can be as expressive as you'd like in these rules!
2. We're going to index some docs to make our application more likely to succeed. To do this - we're going to start with `CTRL+SHIFT+P` (or `CMD+SHIFT+P` on Mac) and we're going to type "custom doc" into the search bar.

3. We're then going to copy and paste `https://nextjs.org/docs` into the prompt.

4. We're then going to use the default configs to add these docs to our available and indexed documents.

5. After that - you will do the same with Vercel's documentation. After which you should see:

  <summary>😎 Vibe Coding a Front End for the FastAPI Backend</summary>

1. Use `Command-L` or `CTRL-L` to open the Cursor chat console. 

2. Set the chat settings to the following:

     ![image](https://i.imgur.com/LSgRSgF.png)

3. Ask Cursor to create a frontend for your application. Iterate as much as you like!

4. Run the frontend using the instructions Cursor provided. 

> NOTE: If you run into any errors, copy and paste them back into the Cursor chat window - and ask Cursor to fix them!

> NOTE: You have been provided with a backend in the `/api` folder - please ensure your Front End integrates with it!

</details>

<details>
  <summary>🚀 Deploying Your First LLM-powered Application with Vercel</summary>

1. Ensure you have signed into [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with your GitHub account.

2. Ensure you have `npm` (this may have been installed in the previous vibe-coding step!) - if you need help with that, ask Cursor!

3. Run the command:

     ```bash
     npm install -g vercel
     ```

4. Run the command:

     ```bash
     vercel
     ```

5. Follow the in-terminal instructions. (Below is an example of what you will see!)

6. Once the build is completed - head to the provided link and try out your app!

> NOTE: Remember, if you run into any errors - ask Cursor to help you fix them!
